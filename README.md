Start recording video on your Raspberry Pi when it boots up.

It takes about 15s to start recording.

Recommendations:
* Boot to Console instead of GUI for a faster boot
* Check out directly to pi user's home directory, and run
  the install script to install it in systemd.

This project is so I can stick a Raspberry Pi onto a drone and
get it to record video.
